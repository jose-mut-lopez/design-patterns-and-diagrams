# Introduction

This project has some example code to practice refactoring.

# How to run

The main application uses stdin and stdout for simple input and output.
To run the application in the terminal, use the following command:
```
./gradlew run --console plain
```

Alternatively, if you are using Intellij or Android Studio, you can click the "Run" button in the gutter next to the main method in `refactoring.App.kt`.
